	<h3>TRUNCATED OR 2/2 HEMOGLOBINS : A NEW CLASS OF GLOBINS WITH NOVEL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION</h3>
	<div><em>Amit Kumar, Moupriya Nag, Soumen Basak</em></div>

		<h4>Abstract</h4>
		<br />
		<div><p>Bright red hemoglobins, the most well-known paradigm in protein science, seem to be ubiquitous innature. With advances in modern tools and techniques, discovery of new globins at a rapid pace has expandedthis family. With every discovery, new insights emerged regarding their novel structure, function and severalother characteristics previously not observed for hemoglobins. Even the classical function unanimously assignedto hemoglobins  oxygen transport and storage  needed re-evaluation. The ability of this class of proteins toshow responses against various gaseous ligands, even the poisonous ones, indicate that it is obviously as ancientas life. As organisms evolved, hemoglobins also evolved, and accumulated a great degree of diversity in allaspects. The classical globin fold is very unique with 3-on-3 alpha helical bundle as observed in the traditionaloxygen-transport hemoglobins like myoglobin, human blood hemoglobin and leghemoglobins in plants. However,a class of the newly discovered hemoglobins, which dominate the superfamily and appears ancient in originmostly have 2-on-2 fold, commonly termed as truncated hemoglobins. These hemoglobins are phylogeneticallydistinct from their classical counterparts and are often shorter in their polypeptide length by 20-40 residuesmainly due to a lack of short A helix, D helix and F helix. However, hemoglobins with 2-on-2 fold were also laterfound to have polypeptide chain lengths similar in size to classical globins. Disordered pre-F helix region,conserved glycine motifs and other key residues and apolar tunnels through their protein matrix for migrationof ligands are some unique characteristics features of these truncated hemoglobins. Some of these are alsohexacoordinated at heme iron where an amino acid from within the protein coordinates heme iron in absence ofa ligand. These hemoglobins are well known for their high affinity towards ligand and have a diverse mechanismof ligand binding involving tunnel system and operated by gate mechanism of conserved residues. Thesehemoglobins seem to act as good detoxificant or scavenger of poisonous gases to protect the harbouring organismin adverse environmental condition. This mechanism might help pathogens harbouring these globins to evadehost defence mechanism during infection. The current review summarizes these findings with regard to truncatedhemoglobins in a comprehensive manner providing insight into structure and function relationship of this novelhemoglobin family.</p><p><br /></p><p>Keywords: Heme; Truncated hemoglobin; 2-on-2 globin fold; 3-on-3 globin fold; hexacoordinate hemoglobin</p><p><br /></p></div>
