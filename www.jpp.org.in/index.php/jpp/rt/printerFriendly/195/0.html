	<h3>PSEUDOAFFINITY CHROMATOGRAPHY ENRICHMENT OF GLYCATED PEPTIDES FOR MONITORING ADVANCED GLYCATION END PRODUCTS (AGES) IN METABOLIC DISORDERS</h3>

		<h4>Abstract</h4>
		<br />
		<div><p>Advanced Glycation End (AGE) products are produced due to diabetic progression and they are responsible for many complications in the diabetic disorder. The diabetic progression is measured, particularly following glycated hemoglobin using specific antibodies. However, the most abundant protein in blood, human serum albumin, is also found to be glycated which has a much shorter half life and gives information on short term glycemic control. In addition, glycated albumins are considered as markers of diabetic complications such as nephropathy, peripheral vascular calcification and also in Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p>The glycation proceeds from the interaction between aldehyde group of sugar and the free amino group of the protein, resulting in the formation of Schiff’s base, which undergoes a series of modifications leading to generation of imidazoyl derivatives of amino acids known as Amadori rearrangement products. The imidazoyl derivatives from arginine and lysine are the most prominent modifications observed in proteins in the presence of reducing sugar and these imidazoyl derivatives have an affinity towards certain transition metal ions. Based on our earlier exhaustive work on trapping the histidine peptides using transition metal ion, Cu(II) linked to imino-diacetate complex, we explored Cu(II) immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) as a potential tool for specific detection of glycated peptides of human serum albumin. Our results clearly demonstrate that Cu(II) IMAC is able to detect glycated peptides very efficiently while the non-glycated forms were not retained on the Cu (II) column as confirmed by LC-MS/MS analysis. We further discuss the utility of IMAC technology to enrich the detection of AGE products in plasma. We anticipate that these studies may provide valuable information on understanding disease pathologies and the potential of AGE products as biomarkers of various diseases including neurodegenerative, renal and cardiovascular diseases.</p><p><strong>Keywords</strong>: Pseudoaffinity chromatography; Glycated peptides; Glycation end products; AGE; Metabolic disorders</p></div>
