		<h4>Abstract</h4>
		<br />
		<div><p>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental condition characterized by impairing symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Though symptoms of hyperactivity diminish with age, inattention and impulsivity persists through adulthood and often leads to behavioral as well as cognitive deficits. Majority of the patients respond to psychostimulants which forms the first line of therapy for ADHD. Some cases however fail to do so and treatment targeting the norepinephrine (NE) system has been found to be an alternative for them. Dopamine (DA) is metabolized to NE by the enzyme dopamine ?-hydroxylase (D?H) and availability of these neurotransmitters in the prefrontal cortex is regulated by D?H. The enzyme is encoded by the DBH gene and polymorphisms in DBH have been found to exert independent influence on the enzymatic activity. We have explored association between DBH and two functional genetic polymorphisms, rs1611115 and rs1108580, in families with ADHD probands and compared with ethnically matched control individuals. Genomic DNA was subjected to PCR amplification followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Plasma D?H activity was measured using a photometric assay. Age-wise D?H activity and its correlation with genetic polymorphisms were analyzed in ADHD subjects. Data obtained were subjected to statistical evaluations. Though the genotypes failed to show any statistically significant association individually, strong correlation was observed between D?H activity and the studied SNPs. Statistically significant correlation between the rs1108580 A allele and hyperactive/oppositional traits were also noticed. The present investigation thus supports a role of DBH in the etiology of ADHD.</p><p>Keywords: ADHD; DBH; genetic polymorphisms; rs1611115; rs1108580.</p></div>
