	<h3>PURIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF ALPHA AMYLASE FROM SEEDS OF PEARL MILLET (Pennisetum typhoides)</h3>
	<div><em>Kerdalin Kharkrang, P K Ambasht</em></div>
			<br />
		<h4>Abstract</h4>
		<br />
		<div><p>Alpha-amylase from pearl millet (<em>Pennisetum typhoides</em>) was purified to homogeneity through several steps involving change of pH (pH 7.0 to 6.0), lyophilization (-55 <sup>o</sup>C), polyethylene glycol precipitation (3-15%), Sepharose 6 B column chromatography and CM-cellulose column chromatography. The 24 fold purified enzyme had specific activity of 580 units/mg protein. Native PAGE revealed a single protein band and activity staining revealed that the band corresponds to alpha amylase. SDS-PAGE also revealed a single protein band. The native molecular mass determined by gel filtration was 33 kDa. The sub-unit molecular mass determined by SDS-PAGE was 33 kDa, suggesting that enzyme is a monomeric protein. The A<sub>280</sub>/A<sub>260</sub> ratio was 1.5, clearly indicating that the enzyme is free from bound nucleotides. When the enzyme was stored at 4<sup>o</sup>C in absence of any additive, t<sub>1/2 </sub> was 90 days. However, when the enzyme was stored at 4<sup>o</sup>C in the presence of acetaminophen, t<sub>1/2</sub> increased to 121 days. The K<sub>m</sub> and V<sub>max</sub> values are 0.5 mg/ml and 603 ?mol/min/mg, respectively. The k<sub>cat</sub> was 335 s<sup>- 1</sup>. From the Arrhenius plot, the activation energy was calculated to be 6.9 kcal/mol. When the enzyme was dialyzed against EDTA (1 mM), negligible loss in activity was observed suggesting that there is no absolute requirement of a divalent cation. However, divalent cations namely, Co<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Ni<sup>2+</sup> at 1mM concentration, activated the enzyme activity. Mn<sup>2+</sup> inhibited the enzyme activity at the same concentration. NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> showed activation of the enzyme activity, Li<sup>+</sup> and K+ showed inhibition. Na<sup>+ </sup>had no effect on the enzyme activity. NAD<sup>+</sup> activated the enzyme activity at 1 mM concentration while ATP, ADP, NADH inhibited the enzyme activity. The latter inhibitors at 3 mM concentration showed non-competitive inhibition. The K<sub>i </sub>values of NADH, ATP and ADP were 3.96 mM, 2.0 mM and 4.48 mM, respectively. At 5 mM concentration, glycine, fructose1,6-bisphosphate and phenylalanine brought activation to the enzyme 4.9, 2.15 and 2.03 fold, respectively with respect to the control. Dicarboxylic acids like glutamic acid, oxalic acid, oxaloacetic acid and fumaric acid inhibited the enzyme activity. In the presence of citrate and urea, complete loss in the enzyme activity was observed. Bovine serum albumin (0.4 mg) and polyethylene glycol (0.4%) brought a 1.9 and 1.4 fold activation with respect to alpha amylase activity.</p><p></p><p>Keywords: alpha amylase purification; kinetics; storage and stability; metabolites.</p></div>
