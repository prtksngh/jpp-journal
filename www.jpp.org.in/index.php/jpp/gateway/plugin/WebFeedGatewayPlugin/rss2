										<title>STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF AN ENDO β-1,3-GLUCANASE OF FAMILY 81 GLYCOSIDE HYDROLASE (CtLam81A) FROM CLOSTRIDIUM THERMOCELLUM</title>
					<link>http://www.jpp.org.in/index.php/jpp/article/view/299</link>
					<description>&lt;div&gt; The gene sequence of a family 81 glycoside hydrolase from Clostridium thermocellum Cthe_0660, (GenBank accession number: ABN51485.1) was retrieved from CAZy (Carbohydrate-Active Enzyme) database. The gene (2151 bp) encoding the catalytic module of Cthe_0660, an endo β-1,3-glucanase (CtLam81A) cloned, expressed earlier was used in this study. The secondary structure analysis of CtLam81A by PsiPred showed the presence of 23% α-helices and 23% β-strands whereas, CD analysis showed 24% of α-helices and 24% of β-strands. The secondary structure analysis by Circular Dichroism corroborated the PsiPred results. The 3D modeled structure of CtLam81 generated by Swiss-Model server and energy minimized by Swiss-PDB viewer displayed an N-terminal â-sandwich domain, a (α/α)6 domain and a short β-sandwich domain at C-terminal. The quality assessment of modelled structure by Ramachandran plot displayed 94% residues in favoured region, 4.6% in allowed region and 1.4% in outlier region. The superposition of CtLam81A modeled structure with its closest homologue Bh0236 (PDB ID: 5t49) from Bacillus halodurans indicated that Glu515 acts as a catalytic base, while Asp438 acts as a catalytic acid. Multiple sequence alignment showed that these catalytic residues are conserved within the family 81 glycoside hydrolase. CtLam81A showed lowest binding energy against laminaripentaose and the amino acid residues, Tyr363, Trp364, Tyr430, Trp588, Trp589 and Trp637create the binding pocket at active site to hold the ligand.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords&lt;/strong&gt;: Family 81 glycoside hydrolase; β-1,3-glucanase; Laminari-oligosaccharides; Circular Dichroism; Homology modeling; Docking; Clostridium thermocellum&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; The gene sequence of a family 81 glycoside hydrolase from Clostridium thermocellum Cthe_0660, (GenBank accession number: ABN51485.1) was retrieved from CAZy (Carbohydrate-Active Enzyme) database.

										<title>REFRACTIVE INDEX OF BLOOD IS A POTENTIAL QUALITATIVE INDICATOR OF HEMOGLOBIN DISORDER IN HUMANS</title>
					<link>http://www.jpp.org.in/index.php/jpp/article/view/301</link>
					<description>&lt;p&gt;Hemoglobin disorders are inherited genetic diseases and a global health burden. The routine diagnostic tools like iso-electric focusing and high performance liquid chromatography based methods are successful in many cases but sometimes yield ambiguous results and are complex, labour-intensive and time consuming. There is thus pressing need of simple molecular tools for identification of hemoglobin disorders. As such, the aim of the present study was to explore a simpler optical property of blood viz. refractive index to differentiate between the blood sample of healthy individuals and those of individuals with hemoglobin disorder. Blood samples were collected from 43 healthy and 63 hemoglobin disorder patients and the refractive index was measured at different processing stages of blood (whole blood, plasma, hemolysate and pure hemoglobin) by using refractometer. The total protein concentration in whole blood was estimated using refractive index in relation to Bradford’s assay and spectrophotometric estimation. The refractive index was found to be directly proportional to total protein concentration. The refractive index values for diseased samples were found to be significantly lower than the healthy controls for whole blood samples, probably due to lower protein content in the former. The change in refractive index values between healthy controls and diseased samples were however not significant in plasma, hemolysate and pure hemoglobin samples probably due to inconsistent dilution during sample processing. Whole blood is thus the material of choice to differentiate between the healthy and the diseased samples using refractive index. Refractive index of blood could serve as a potential tool for qualitative diagnostics of hemoglobin disorders in near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords&lt;/strong&gt;: Hemoglobin disorders; refractive index; whole blood; hemolysate, diagnostics; hemoglobin variants; Hemoglobind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

										<title>STRUCTURAL INTRICACY OF DISORDERED REGIONS IN TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS IMPARTING COLON CANCER</title>
					<link>http://www.jpp.org.in/index.php/jpp/article/view/302</link>
					<description>&lt;p&gt;Transcription factors (TFs) linked to cancer contains a significant amount of disordered segments and the dynamics as well as coupling of it with partner molecules are keys in the processes of recognization and many other cellular activities. However, the sequence distribution, composition and the structural adaptability of TFs in the presence of other interacting small and large macromolecules such as nucleic acids, lipids and other proteins are not well understood. In a recent article (Specific DNA Sequences Allosterically Enhance Protein–Protein Interaction in a Transcription Factor, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.) we showed that a small fluctuation in energetic and related conformational adaptation is a key in the recognition of multiple DNA sequences by TFs. In the current investigation we determined and showed the amino acid residue distribution, intrinsic characteristics, conformational adaptability of the disorder regions and their similarity among the TFs which are linked to colon cancer. About 38% of the residues in TFs in average found to belong in the disordered region (DoR) and the abundance of these DoRs follows a Poisson distribution pattern with an expectancy value of 12. Interestingly, the size (length) distribution of the individual DoR also follows a similar statistical pattern. The computational analysis further establishes the tertiary structure of many of the TFs by homology modeling and, it was observed that the TFs with disordered content less than 70% can attain different kind of tertiary folds. However, a significant segments preferred to remain as disordered (coiled coil) and found to localize preferentially on the surface of the proteins. This surface localization suggested interactive and functional links of the disordered regions with proteins and genomic materials involves in cell function and other biological activities. The presence and their localization may thus aid in the understanding of eukaryotic gene transcription machinery as well as developing new drugs targeting the disorder prone regions in the TFs to cure cancers and related human diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords&lt;/strong&gt;: TFs; Secondary structure; DoR; Functional link; PSIPRED&lt;/p&gt;</description>

										<title>ANTI-ENZYME ANTIBODIES: STABILIZATION AND THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL</title>
					<link>http://www.jpp.org.in/index.php/jpp/article/view/300</link>
					<description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Anti-enzyme antibodies can be utilized for various purposes. They have been used for single step immunoaffinity purification of enzymes and for their immobilization. Both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies have been employed in the immobilization of enzymes. The resulting immobilized enzymes exhibit almost full activity and enhanced stability. Antibodies raised against the peptides corresponding to the labile region of enzymes can be used to prepare affinity supports that bind and selectively confer enhanced stability to them. Antibodies can facilitate folding and prevent aggregation of protein antigens. This chaperone-like antibody activity may prove to be a promising approach to the treatment of Alzheimer’s and prion-related diseases. The antibodies have immense therapeutic potential and are being utilized to treat various diseases. This review aims at giving an overview on the stabilization of enzymes by antibodies and the therapeutic potential of the anti-enzyme antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords&lt;/strong&gt;: Enzymes; Antibodies; Stabilization; Therapeutic potential.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
